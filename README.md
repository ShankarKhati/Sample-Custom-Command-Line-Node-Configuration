# Sample-Custom-Command-Line-Node-Configuration
As we all knows while we are creating a new project in Angular 7-8 we already have a command line tool by which we could generate our components/ services/ css/ scss and routing as well, But while we are trying to create an Node project were we need to make a standard for creating controller. At that time we need to create style guides for the same but If we could create our own custom command line tool for generating controller/services and so as we have in Angular CLI it would be great helpful for all developers with in the team.
